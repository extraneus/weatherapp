Hereâ€™s a sample README.md file for your weather app project:
Weather App

This Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions in any city. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the corresponding weather icon.
Features

    Search Functionality: Users can search for the weather by entering a city name.
    Live Weather Data: The app retrieves real-time weather data, including temperature (in Celsius), humidity, wind speed, and the weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, misty, etc.).
    Dynamic Weather Icons: The app dynamically updates the weather icon based on the current weather conditions (e.g., clouds, clear, mist, etc.).

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.
    CSS3: For styling the UI components, making the app visually appealing.
    JavaScript (ES6+): To handle API calls and DOM manipulation.
    OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching real-time weather data.
